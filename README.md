# TicTacToe
## Description
This is a simple web-based game of Tic Tac Toe developed as a part of [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/full-stack-javascript/courses/javascript/lessons/tic-tac-toe). The purpose of this project was to practice using the Factory Function and Module design patterns. This is my first project in JavaScript where I tucked functionality into appropriate objects and was able to hide unimportant helper functions. I feel like this project gave me a good baseline in proper vanilla JavaScript development.

## Usage
To run it locally, just load index.html or check it out at https://daisykucharski.github.io/TicTacToe/.

## Future Expansion
I don't plan on expanding on this project too much in the future. If I were to expand this project, I would create an AI for the user to play against, using the minimax algoritihm. I would also have different difficulty levels to choose from.
